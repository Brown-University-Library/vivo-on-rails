    <h2>About Researchers@Brown</h2>

    <p>Researchers@Brown brings together, in one site, publicly available information
      on the people, departments, and activities that collectively make up research
      and scholarship in all disciplines at Brown University. Researchers@Brown is
      an implementation of <a href="http://vivoweb.org">VIVO</a>, an open community,
      open information model, and open source semantic web application. VIVO was
      originally developed at Cornell University and was improved and expanded
      via an National Institutes of Health (NIH) multi-institution grant in 2009 - 2012.
      VIVO is currently a project of <a href="http://duraspace.org/">DuraSpace</a>,
      an independent 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization whose mission is to
      “preserve and provide access to the world's intellectual, cultural and
      scientific heritage” by supporting open technologies that provide long-term,
      durable access to digital assets. VIVO is currently in use at over 150
      institutions worldwide.

    <h3>Profiles</h3>
    <p>Researcher@Brown profiles for new faculty are automatically generated
      based on information in a daily feed from the Faculty Information System
      (FIS). These initial shell profiles contain name and email (from Workday),
      department(s), title(s), position(s), degrees (from FIS), and courses taught
      (from Banner). Faculty (or deputies) add additional data via a Profile Manager.
      Publications are harvested once a week from Web of Science and PubMed;
      these publications must be approved by the faculty member before they
      appear on the public profile. Harvested publications contain links to full
      text if available.
    </p>

    <p>Information on the inclusion policy for profiles is available on our
      <a href="https://library.brown.edu/vivo/faq.html#who">FAQ</a> page.
