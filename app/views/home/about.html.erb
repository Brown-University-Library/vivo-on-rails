    <h2>About Researchers@Brown</h2>

    <p>Researchers@Brown brings together, in one site, publicly available
      information on the people, departments, and activities that collectively
      make up research and scholarship in all disciplines at Brown.
      Researchers@Brown is an implementation of
      <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/VIVO+Main+Page">VIVO</a>,
      an open-source, linked open data, research networking tool developed at
      Cornell University and currently in use at a growing number of institutions
      worldwide.</p>

    <p>All information in the initial release of Researchers@Brown comes from
      institutional sources (Workday, FIS, Banner) and from faculty profiles in
      the Directory of Research and Researchers at Brown (DRR-B). As the
      infrastructure of the DRR-B is outdated and no longer sustainable,
      Researchers@Brown provides a more functional and sustainable environment
      than the DRR-B.</p>

    <p>An external interface for managing Researchers@Brown profiles has been built
      to avoid the inflexibilities and difficulties of use found in the native
      VIVO editor.</p>

    <p>DRR-B profiles have been automatically redirected to the new
      Researchers@Brown profiles.</p>

    <a name="implementation"></a><h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
    <p>
    To ensure as smooth a transition as possible from the DRR-B, Reseachers@Brown has been rolled
    out in phases. With each phase, training and support are available to faculty and their deputies. All faculty are encouraged to use the new system to its full potential.

    <ul style="list-style:disc;margin-left:25px;">
    <li> <span style="color:black">Phase 1 (November 2013 - April 2014): Migration of DRR-B Data and User Testing</span><br />

    Data from DRR-B profiles was migrated to Researchers@Brown by March 1, 2014. In addition to the
    information carried over from the DRR-B, these new profiles include
    teaching information from Banner and name, title, department, degree, and contact information from
    the Faculty Information System (FIS). An attached PDF file of the faculty
    memberâ€™s CV (from the DRR-B) was included as well.
    <br /><br />

    In December, 2013 and January 2014, we conducted extensive testing of Researchers@Brown with participation by 57 faculty members across 44 academic departments, receiving overall positive feedback from those who reviewed their data and tested the functionality of R@B.  While faculty offered a number of good suggestions for future enhancements, most indicated that it is a clear improvement over DRR-B and significantly better than the earlier implementation of VIVO.<br /><br />

    During a soft launch in March and April 2014, faculty were able to review and edit their new profiles while their DRR-B profiles remained visible but not editable.  On May 1, 2014, Researchers@Brown went live, the DRR-B was decommissioned, and DRR-B profiles were automatically
    redirected to the new Researchers@Brown profiles. <br /><br />

    The information displayed in the newly-created public profiles is read-only.
    Faculty and their deputies edit profiles in an external, user-friendly interface by clicking "Manage your profile" on the top right of every page. <br /><br /></li>

    <li><span style="color:black">Phase 2 (May - July 2014): Structured Publication Data</span><br />
    A user-friendly editor for publications was launched on July 1, 2014 in conjunction with harvesting of publications for Biology and Public Health.  This editor allows all faculty to easily add and edit structured publication data by entering a citation or simply a DOI or PubMed ID.  This publications data will include links to <a href="http://vivo.brown.edu/themes/brown/images/full_text2.htm">full text</a> if a DOI is available.<br /><br />

    For Biology and Public Health faculty, publication data from vendor-parsed CVs was used to seed harvesting of additional publications using Harvard's Catalyst API.    Structured publication data
    is intended to replace plain text citations in the "Scholarly Work" section of Researchers@Brown.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li><span style="color:black">Phase 3 (Summer - October 2014): Hospital-based Faculty Data and and Governance Structure</span><br />
    Select publication data from vendor-parsed CVs will be loaded into profiles for hospital-based faculty. Publication data from vendor-parsed CVs will be used to seed harvesting of additional publications using Harvard's Catalyst API.  <br /><br />

    Plans will be developed for harvesting from sources other than PubMed (Web of Science, etc) and on behalf of other faculty groups and disciplines.<br /><br />

    A governance structure will be established to set policies and priorities for the maintenance and further development of Researchers@Brown.

      If you entered publication information in the DRR-B as free text or a text
      file, that data has been carried over to Researchers@Brown under the heading
      "Scholarly Work".  PDF lists of publications have not been carried over from
      the DRR-B. These publications are available on your uploaded CV and can also
      be entered in the "Scholarly Work" text box.</p>

    <p><span style="color:red">**</span>
      The "Publications" section in Researchers@Brown offers a sophisticated
      approach to publication data. This publication data is highly structured and
      allows for automatic links to library-licensed or freely available FULL TEXT.
      In addition, the editing interface allows the automated retrieval of full
      citation data upon entry of a DOI or PMID.  A harvesting service allows
      Biology and Public Health faculty to approve a list of their recent publications
      for automatic entry into their profiles. You can learn more about this in
      <a href="<%= home_publications_path() %>">the publications page</a>.</p>
